Warranty Policy

Most electronic products sold on our platform include a manufacturer warranty.

Smartphones, laptops, and major electronic devices typically carry a 12-month warranty, unless stated otherwise on the product page. Accessories may have a 3 to 6-month warranty.

The warranty covers manufacturing defects only. Damage caused by misuse, accidents, water exposure, or unauthorized repairs is not covered.

To claim warranty service, customers must provide proof of purchase and contact customer support. Warranty claims may involve repair, replacement, or refund based on manufacturer guidelines.

Warranty service timelines depend on the manufacturer and product category.
