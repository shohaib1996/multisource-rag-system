Refund & Return Policy

We offer refunds and returns to ensure customer satisfaction. Customers may request a return within 14 days of receiving the product.

Electronics such as laptops, smartphones, and accessories are eligible for return only if they are unused, unopened, and in original packaging. Opened or used electronics are not refundable unless the item is defective.

Non-electronic accessories may be returned if they are unused and in resellable condition.

Refunds are processed to the original payment method within 5–7 business days after the returned item is inspected and approved.

Shipping fees are non-refundable. Products purchased during clearance or promotional sales are final and non-returnable.

To initiate a return, customers must contact customer support with their order ID and reason for return.
