Shipping Policy

We provide shipping services for all confirmed orders placed on our platform.

Standard domestic delivery takes 3–5 business days. Express delivery options may be available at additional cost. International shipping typically takes 7–14 business days, depending on the destination.

Shipping fees are calculated at checkout based on order value, weight, and delivery location.

Once an order is shipped, customers receive a tracking number via email. Delivery delays may occur due to weather conditions, customs clearance, or courier issues.

We are not responsible for delays caused by incorrect shipping information provided by the customer.
